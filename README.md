# Web Application | Lab 2 | Invoice Handler

Second lab for our Web Application frontend course at IT-HÃ¶gskolan, Gothenburg.
This is a simple app where you add services and products to a list, which then is transferred to an invoice template for easy printout.
The purpose of this lab was to get familiar with the Vue 3 framework, working with Router views and Components.

Please see the Lab-2-Vg-Notes in the Planning folder for more information.
